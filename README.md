# ecommerce-_product_analytics
 This is a personal project to get product analytics on initialy Jumia and and other ecommerce sites. It is deployed at https://product-analytics-ke.herokuapp.com/. The first feature is a reviews crawler. Just paste a product link to the website and download a csv containing all the reviews, stars and date posted for further analysis. 
 A few more features such as sentiment analysis and product comparison are currently under development.
